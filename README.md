# GOGI

Go Graphics Interface - Lame name, I know, I know.

Basically, I wanted to do a plasma demo in the browser with Go. This is how I ended up with this. It looks like I built a mini-graphics library in the end because that's what I did. The code is there, I'll document it more/better/further as I get time.

I'm using TinyGo and you can check the task file to see the commands used to create the wasm binary.
